SyntaxHighlighter Evolved: Rust Brush
=====================================

This Wordpress Plugin adds support for the Rust language to the [SyntaxHighlighter Evolved](http://wordpress.org/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/) plugin using the Brush created by [しらいと](http://silight.hatenablog.jp/entry/2015/06/18/211724).

This plugin is remarkably simply to use. Once you've installed the SyntaxHighligher Evolved plugin, simply upload this plugin and activate it. Then you can add Rust highlighting to any code simply by wrapping it in the "rs" or "rust" shortcode.
